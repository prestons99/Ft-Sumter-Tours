 <p ion-text color="light">Fort Sumter, best known as the location where the Civil War began, is located
   at the entrance to the historic Charleston Harbor. For some, the Civil War
   is considered a second American Revolution; it changed who we are as a country.
   The Civil War resulted in roughly 700,000 casualties; Americans fighting Americans.
   Here at Fort Sumter, approximately 70 Confederate and Union soldiers, and enslaved
   African Americans lost their lives. A direct outcome of the war was ratification of 
   the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that ended slavery in the United States.
   Americans were forced to begin to live up to our ideals of freedom and equality. As
   you enjoy your visit, consider the significance of events that happened here and help
   us protect the fort by not climbing, sitting, or standing on the brickwork or cannon.
   The site is preserved as a unit of the National Park Service and listed on the National Park
   Register of Historic Places. It is ranked by Conde Nast Readers' Choice Awards as a #1
   top U.S. destination.</p>
