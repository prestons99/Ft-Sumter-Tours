    <p>With Fort Sumter in Confederate hands, the port of Charleston continued to be a problem for the Federal naval Blockade of the Atlantic coast.&nbsp; Capture of Port Royal Harbor (near Beaufort, SC) in November 1861 made it possible to plan land and sea operations against Charleston from this southern base.&nbsp; In June 1862 Federal Major General David Hunter unsuccessfully attempted to push through James Island (south of the city) to attack Charleston.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On April 5, 1863, a fleet of nine Federal ironclads appeared off the Charleston bar.&nbsp; With ebb tide on the afternoon of the 7th, the ironclads steamed single-file up the main ship channel east of Morris Island.&nbsp; They were repulsed, however, by heavy fire from Fort Sumter, Fort Moultrie and Cummings Point on Morris Island.</p>
    <p>Federal forces eventually captured nearby Folly and Coles Islands, intending to take Morris Island.&nbsp; From there they would be able to bombard Fort Sumter and the city of Charleston.&nbsp; Confederates inside Fort Sumter prepared for the attack.&nbsp; They sandbagged the main entrance and filled the casemates with sand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rooms along the gorge wall were filled with damp cotton bales laid in sand.&nbsp; By the end of June 1863, the fort was garrisoned by five companies (about 500 men) and was armed with 68 guns and mortars.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On July 10 the attack began.&nbsp; Three thousand Union infantrymen, supported by ships and artillery on Folly Island, descended on Morris Island.&nbsp; Within four hours, most of the island was under Union control.&nbsp; Confederate forces fell back to Battery Wagner, a strong earthen fortification whose guns commanded nearly the entire length of the island.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 18 the 54thMassachusetts, a regiment of 600 free black men recruited from various Northern States led a heavy assault against the battery. After suffering horrific casualties, the Union forces fell back.&nbsp; When Battery Wagner finally fell to Union forces in September, General Quincy Gillmore brought in heavy rifled cannon, determined to batter the Confederate forces into submission.</p>
    <p>On August 17 the bombardment began, firing almost 6,000 shells during that first week.&nbsp; Gillmore demanded the evacuation of Fort Sumter and Morris Island, or he promised to fire on Charleston.&nbsp; Before the Confederates could confirm the source of the demand and respond, Gillmore opened fire.&nbsp; By August 23 Fort Sumter fired its last shots &ndash; its brick masonry walls were shattered and undermined; a breach yawned in the left face.&nbsp; General Gillmore&rsquo;s chief of artillery reported &ldquo;The demolition of the fort&hellip;was complete so far as its offensive powers were considered.&nbsp; Every gun upon the parapet was either dismounted or seriously damaged.&nbsp; The place&hellip;was a ruin, and effectually disabled for any immediate defense of the harbor of Charleston.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>His assessment, however, was premature.&nbsp; The Confederate garrison inside transformed the fort &ldquo;from a shapeless pile of shattered walls and casemates&hellip;into a powerful earthwork, impregnable to assault.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Confederate garrison held on.&nbsp; About 200-400 enslaved laborers were forced to work night and day, strengthening and repairing the fort&rsquo;s crumbling walls.</p>
    <p>Once again on July 7, 1864 federal guns opened a sustained bombardment, firing an average of 350 rounds per day at the fort.&nbsp;&nbsp; Debris added to debris, and thousands of sandbags were brought from the city, making the fort stronger than ever.&nbsp; This was the last great bombardment of Fort Sumter.&nbsp; After September 1864, less than 100 rounds were fired at the fort.</p>
    <p>In February 1865 this long stalemate came to an end as Union General William T. Sherman made his famous march to the sea, then turned north and west through Columbia, the center of South Carolina.&nbsp; Fort Sumter and the other Confederate fortifications in Charleston harbor were quietly evacuated.&nbsp; On the morning of February 18th, the US flag was once more raised over Fort Sumter.</p>
