    Elegant southern style and charm combined with functionality makes this boat a great way to see the Harbor and Fort Sumter.
    The Spirit of the Lowcountry is loaded with amenities, starting with the spacious partially covered upper deck.
    When you step onto this deck you really feel like you are part of the surrounding beauty of Charleston Harbor.
    This boat has seven restrooms, an elevator for guests with mobility issues, two fully equipped bars, and two heated/air conditioned dining decks.
    The decor on this boat is one of the crowning features, with beautiful window tapestries, banquette seating and classic lighting fixtures;
    this boat is a true gem.
