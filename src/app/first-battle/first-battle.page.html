    <p>After South Carolina seceded from the Union in December 1860, Federal soldiers under the command of Major Robert Anderson had moved from Fort Moultrie (on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island) to Fort Sumter, believing they would be safer there.&nbsp; For the next four months the newly-formed Confederacy would attempt to negotiate with the Federal Government to take possession of the fort.&nbsp; Both sides hoped for a peaceful resolution.&nbsp; By April, however, Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard and Confederate Secretary of War Leroy Pope Walker believed the stand-off between Confederate forces and Major Anderson&rsquo;s garrison in the fort had gone on long enough.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On Thursday, April 11, 1861, General Beauregard sent three aides, Colonel James Chesnut, Jr., Captain Stephen D. Lee and Lieutenant A. R.Chisolm to demand the surrender of the fort.&nbsp; Anderson declined.&nbsp; After consulting the Confederate Secretary of War, Beauregard sent his aides back to the fort and authorized Chesnut to decide whether the fort should be taken by force.&nbsp; The aides waited while Anderson considered his alternatives.&nbsp; At about 3:00 a.m. when Anderson finally stated his conditions for surrender, Colonel Chesnut decided they were &ldquo;manifestly futile and not within the scope of the instructions verbally given to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The aides then left the fort and proceeded to nearby Fort Johnson.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there, at about 4:30 a.m., the first shot of what would become the Civil War was fired upon Fort Sumter.</p>
    <p>Forty-three Confederate batteries immediately opened fire.&nbsp; Edmund Ruffin, noted Virginian agronomist and secessionist, later claimed that he had fired the first shot.&nbsp; His story was widely believed, but the first shot was actually fired by Lieutenant Henry S. Farley, following the order of his batter commander Captain George S. James.&nbsp; According to Mary Chesnut (wife of Colonel Chesnut), Charleston residents gathered on rooftops and balconies to watch the battle, drinking salutes to the start of the hostilities.</p>
    <p>Anderson and his men made no attempt to return fire for more than two hours, waiting for daylight.&nbsp; The fort contained a limited supply of ammunition, few cartridge bags, and no fuses for their explosive shells.&nbsp; Only sold irons balls could be fired against the Confederate batteries.&nbsp; At about 7:00 a.m., Captain Abner Doubleday, the forts&rsquo; second in command, fired the first returning shot in defense of the fort.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The firing continued all day.&nbsp; At night fire from the fort stopped to conserve ammunition.&nbsp; The Confederates, however, lobbed an occasional shell into the fort.&nbsp; The following day, Saturday, April 13, Confederate batteries on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island fired hot shot into the fort (cannonballs heated in a furnace), which started fires in the Officers&rsquo; Quarters.&nbsp; Anderson&rsquo;s men did not have the resources to fight the fire and continue the battle, so after 34 hours, the decision was made to surrender.</p>
    <p>There were no recorded deaths on either side during the attack, but as Anderson&rsquo;s men attempted to fire a 100 gun salute at the lowering of their flag, an accidental explosion killed Private Daniel Hough.&nbsp; Private Edward Galloway was wounded and would die from his wounds a few days later.&nbsp;&nbsp; The men boarded supply ships and headed for New York, where the Fort Sumter flag became a popular patriotic symbol.&nbsp; Today the flag is on display in the fort&rsquo;s museum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
